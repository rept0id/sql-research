## Haversine Formula vs Spherical Law of cosines

### Analysis

#### Haversine Formula

It involves more calculations, thus requiring more computing power. But, it's more accurate.

It originates from *José de Mendoza y Ríos* (1801) and *James Andrew* (1805).

#### Spherical Law of Cosines

It involves fewer calculations, thus requiring less computing power. However, it's less accurate.

It originates from *Al-Khwarizmi* (9th century), *al-Battani* (9th century), and *Nīlakaṇṭha* (15th century).
