# Distance

## Haversine Formula vs Spherical Law of cosines

### Analysis

#### Haversine Formula
- more calculations, more computing power needed
- more accurate - good for small distances

#### Spherical Law of Cosines
- less calculations, less computing power needed
- less accurate - good for huge distances, bad for small
