## Haversine Formula vs Spherical Law of cosines

### Analysis

#### Haversine Formula

It involves more calculations, thus requiring more computing power. But, it's more accurate.

It originates from José de Mendoza y Ríos (1801) and James Andrew (1805).

#### Spherical Law of Cosines

It involves fewer calculations, thus requiring less computing power. However, it's less accurate.

It originates from Al-Khwarizmi (9th century), al-Battani (9th century), and Nīlakaṇṭha (15th century).
